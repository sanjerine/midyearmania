## Overview

Every mid-semester break I run a small tournament with my friends where we are sorted into teams and compete in a variety of events, with the highest scoring team being crowned the winner. What better way to 'spice up' competition than to introduce a friendly, gambling aspect? :grin:

I decided to build a website to allow users to 'gamble' with their points on the outcomes of other events. Markets are dynamic, with odds changing depending on the liquidity of an event. When an event's time concludes, it is unable to be wagered on. Users are sorted into teams, and the status of each team is displayed on the homepage as the event runs. The wninning team is the team with the highest average points!
